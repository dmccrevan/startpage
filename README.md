# Clean Start Page
Clean start page using HTML, CSS and Javascript (no server-side rendering required).  Feel free to download, modify and distribute as you wish!  Uses the materialize framework as a base

# Instructions
This can be served via a server, or accessed locally (up to you).  Simply extract the files to a location of your choice, edit the HTML with the links you wish to have on your front page, and then open the index.html file with your browser.

## Explanation of files:

# bg.js
Used for inserting a random background from the imgs folder. If you want more images to be included, simply add them to the imgs folder with the nomenclature of "bg1.jpg", "bg2.jpg", etc.  Then, open this file and add the file names to the variable.

# clock.js
Used for rendering the clock on the homepage.  It's simple, and doesn't have much functionality.  Will render to a DIV with the id of TXT.

# Style.css
Used for custom styling.  Will overwrite anything from the materialize project.
